<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>If you’ve ever thought, <strong>“I want to sell my unused junk for cash in Mumbai,”</strong> you’re not alone.

<hr>
<h2>Why I Want to Sell My Unused Junk for Cash in Mumbai</h2>
<p>There are several personal and practical reasons why people in Mumbai look for ways to sell their unused junk:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Extra Income</strong> – Even small piles of scrap can add up to decent cash. For example, old newspapers, wires, and bottles can easily fetch hundreds of rupees.</li>

<h2>Challenges of Traditional Scrap Selling</h2>
<p>Before platforms like Scrapiz, people depended on <strong>local kabadiwalas</strong>. But that often came with problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Unclear Pricing</strong> – Dealers often quoted random prices without transparency.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistent Service</strong> – You never knew when the kabadiwala would show up.</li>
<li><strong>Payment Delays</strong> – Many households faced issues with partial or late payments.</li>
<li><strong>No Eco-Guarantee</strong> – There was no way to ensure that the scrap was recycled properly.</li>
</ul>
<p>This made many people hesitant to sell their junk, even when they wanted to.</p>
